# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using a supervised machine learning model â€” Logistic Regression. It utilizes a publicly available dataset that contains anonymized transaction records, including both legitimate and fraudulent entries.

##  Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Analyze and understand the distribution of fraud and valid transactions.
- Train a logistic regression model to classify transactions.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Dataset Overview

- Total records: 284,807
- Features: Time, Amount, and 28 anonymized PCA components (`V1` to `V28`)
- Target: Class(0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)
- Fraudulent transactions: only 492 (highly imbalanced)



## Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
  - Train-test split (80/20)

- **Model**:
  - Logistic Regression (`max_iter=1000`)
  - Trained on scaled features

- **Evaluation**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    

## Key Findings

- Fraudulent transactions are a very small fraction of the dataset.
- The `Amount` feature had to be scaled due to its variance.
- Logistic Regression model was able to detect some fraud, but performance can improve with class-balancing or other algorithms.
